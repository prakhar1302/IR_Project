# Health Support System

## Problem Statement
Manual research for medical information and treatment options can be time-consuming and complex, particularly for individuals with limited medical knowledge. Accessing relevant medical information efficiently is crucial for making informed decisions about healthcare. An automated solution can streamline this process and provide accessible support.

## Proposed Solution
Our proposed solution for the health support system includes:

- **Symptom Extraction and Mapping**:
  - Utilizes advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically Named Entity Recognition (NER), for accurate symptom extraction.
  - Cleans and maps symptoms to diseases to lay the foundation for precise disease prediction.

- **Disease Prediction with SVC**:
  - Applies the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) algorithm to learn patterns between symptoms and diseases.
  - Enhances diagnostic capabilities by accurately predicting diseases based on user-input symptoms.

- **Personalized Recommendations**:
  - Generates comprehensive recommendations tailored to each user, including personalized diet plans, workout routines, medication suggestions, and precautionary measures.

- **Medication Analysis with AI**:
  - Integrates Gemini Pro AI for detailed medication analysis, considering medication data and predicted symptoms/diseases.
  - Provides insights into medication advantages, disadvantages, and additional precautions.

- **OCR Technology for Medication Insights**:
  - Incorporates Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to extract detailed medication information from uploaded labels.
  - Enhances user engagement by providing specific medication details for informed healthcare decisions.

## Features
- **Empowering Health through Technology**: Revolutionizing healthcare with advanced NLP and SVC algorithms for precise disease prediction and personalized recommendations.
  
- **Harnessing AI for Better Health**: Utilizing Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract symptoms accurately and map them to diseases, ensuring effective healthcare management.

- **Insights Beyond Diagnosis**: Integrating Gemini Pro AI for comprehensive medication analysis, offering detailed insights into treatment options and their impacts.

- **Seamless User Experience**: Enhancing user engagement with OCR technology, enabling detailed medication insights directly from uploaded labels for informed healthcare decisions.
